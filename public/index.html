<p> The Super Bowl was a meeting between two teams, of course, but for Gabe Leydon, creator of Game of War: Fire Age, it was an all-out strategy game showdown. Consistently in the top five apps worldwide by revenue, Game of War has been grossing more than one million dollars a day, according to Think Gaming, double what it was bringing in just last spring. While Leydon won’t confirm this, the company’s annual revenue has been estimated at more than $600 million. But as much as it has been earning, Game of War has been trailing Supercell’s nominally similar Clash of Clans for most of that time. And so on that Sunday, the two developers did battle via media buys. Clash of Clans brought a rapier: Liam Neeson, with a witty, irony-laden riff on a dude addicted to his fantasy duels. Gabe Leydon brought a nuclear bomb: Kate Upton. She emerged from some kind of medieval hot tub, and, donning body armor in slow-motion, plunged into a melee of monsters and knights. “Do you want to come and play?” she asked, and for some fanboys, the game’s score no longer mattered. </p>

<p>Critics had their opinions of course, but in the real world, Game of War trounced its enemy. In the hours after the Super Bowl, the game passed its rival, as measured by downloads from Apple’s app store.  Which is exactly what Leydon had hoped for when Machine Zone spent $40 million to hire Upton as their spokeswoman, as part of a four-month campaign by Untitled Worldwide. </p>

<p> The Super Bowl was something of a coming out party for multi-player games for iOS and Android phones like Game of War and Clash of Clans. (A third game, Ucool’s Heroes Charge, also advertised). Unlike the games played on consoles like Sony’s Playstation or Microsoft’s Xbox, most successful app games can seem pretty downmarket, with cheap-looking graphics and no immersive storyline—just crushing candies and clashing clans. Game of War seems cheesy at first—a little like Civilization, a little like FarmVille. The goddess Athena cheers on from the sidelines as players build cities, amass armies, strike up alliances with other players, all of whom interact on a large map of kingdoms and battles. Leydon says hiring Upton was inspired, in part, by the success of Glu Mobile’s Kim Kardashian-starring app. “We found somebody who resonated with sports fans,” he says. “Football’s the only time people watch commercials. And she’s pretty, and she looks like the character inside the game.”</p>

<p>In Clash of Clans and virtually every other mobile game, the contests and battles are one-on-one. But in Game of War everyone in the world tangles with one another in the same enormous virtual world, all at the same time. That complexity has attracted !!!!! a small but significant number to make micro-purchases of virtual currency, or gold, inside the game. The purchases are the nub of the “free-to-play” business (Clash of Clans also has “gems” available for purchase). In one extreme case, Het Nieuwsblad in Belgium reported last year that a fifteen-year-old Game of War player from Antwerp spent $50,000  on in-app purchases, to his mother’s annoyance. Riches matter in the virtual world of Game of War, but domination over other players matters more. Buying gold gives players the ability to build things faster, making them more attractive candidates for alliances. And its those alliances—and the ability to play with not just with dozens but thousands of people all over the world, in real time—that gives Game of War devotees a special little rush. Leydon even goes so far as to argue that it is more social network than game, and part of the reason that Game of War may seem less ubiquitous in the United States is that its user growth is so internationally dispersed.</p>

<p>That growth, and the in-app purchases, explains the $1 million or more Machine Zone is bringing in each day. According to TKTKTK, Leydon has been in talks with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. about raising funding at a valuation of more than $3 billion, which would match the $3 billion valuation Supercell reached with funding from Japan’s SoftBank. </p>


<p>“Culturally, it’s shocking to people,” Leydon says. “They say it’s just an app game. They don’t understand the scale of what’s happening here in the industry, because it’s kind of a sea change.” Indeed, free and mobile gamers made up 29 percent of the overall game-playing audience last year, more than three times larger than the core console-playing audience, according to a marketing study released last spring by the NPD Group. Console and software sales, meanwhile, have dropped every year since 2008, according to Michael Pachter, a gaming analyst at Wedbush Securities. </p>

<p> In Leydon’s view, Upton vs Neeson was just the first bout. “Next Superbowl,” he says, “You might see ten ads.”</p>

<p>Machine Zone has 300 employees, most of them in Palo Alto. Met there recently, Leydon, 35, looks cheerful if a little haggard, riding on three hours of sleep, working a heavy layer of stubble and wearing the usual Zuckerberg-style hoodie. The office is the size of a warehouse, and in one dimly lit alcove, Leydon has stashed a relic from his past. It’s a coin-operated single-shooter arcade game from 2007 called America’s Army. Leydon grew up in the Silicon Valley, spending whatever time he wasn’t on a skateboard playing arcade games. After a detour in sound-engineering school, he got his start designing arcade games for Atari, Tsunami Visual, and others. Leydon spent a spent a year pitching America’s Army to the Pentagon—it was a stripped-down shoot-em-up adaptation of PC software the Army had been marketing as a recruitment tool—and finally another year and a half developing it for arcade-game-maker Global VR. Shortly before he was done, YouTube’s founders sold their company for $1.65 billion. “It was amazing,” he says, shaking his head. “Two young guys. They worked on it for, like, a year and a half. I was like, ‘That’s engineering, and what I’m doing is engineering. What’s the difference between what I’m doing and what they’re doing?’”</p>


<p>Leydon abandoned the arcade world, which was dying anyway, while holding on to one arcade-related skill set: the ability to design games that persuade players to spend money in order to keep on playing. Leydon was one of the first to see in the app store the potential of a virtual supermarket in everyone’s pocket and purse, but he had to fail a few more times before really getting it. At the time, Apple’s app store hadn’t quite arrived, but Facebook apps were surging. “You heard about these Stanford students making $100,000 a month making Kiss Me apps. People were making stuff over a weekend around here.” With his partners Mike Sherill and Halbert Nakagawa, Leydon started a company called Addmired. “We were kind of afraid to compete on Facebook,” he says. “Zynga was 300 people. We were just three people.” So the company’s first apps were on MySpace, among them a photo-sharing precursor to Instagram called Addable. Addable was popular but unprofitable; Leydon noticed how the photos were secondary to the social aspect, and the most viral aspect of the app was how “it turned into a chat room.” But the three partners were just barely surviving. “We were working out of a 300-square-foot studio apartment. My cofounder’s bed was right next to me, and I had a $15 chair that permanently wrecked my back. Big mistake.” </p>

<p>In 2008, the company used a few thousand dollars of seed money from the startup funder Y Combinator to start work on what is commonly recognized as the first free-to-play app for the iPhone, a largely text-based role-playing game called iMob, which they built in three months. Back then, there was no such thing as an “in-app purchase”; instead, Leydon gave away a free version of the game, hoping enough players would get hooked and buy a paid version that unlocked virtual currency within the game. “We finished it a month before we released it,” he says, “because I thought no one would want to play it.” When it finally launched, iMob worked a little too well: Hundreds of thousands of people downloaded it, more coming every day. “The first day, we couldn’t believe what was happening. The second day, it was shocking. The third day, nothing worked.” </p>

<p>The system crashed. “We weren’t sleeping, we did everything possible to keep that game going for two or three months.” All the money they made went out the door, spent on contractors to keep the game going. “We did so many things wrong, just out of ignorance for how online games work, that it kind of became a mission in the company to solve that problem, to make sure we didn’t go through that again.” </p>

<p>Leydon recognized then that the future of mobile games wasn’t with fancy console-style graphics. “People were trying to put console games on the iPhone,” he says. “But it’s different. If your game’s just about graphics it’s not going to work.” Smartphones, he realized, commandeer short bursts of attention. But some people check they’re phones a hundred times a day or more. “They’re looking for something to do. They’re trying to fill time. And they’re jumping from app to app.” A successful game needed to require players to make quick decisions and then not be able to resist coming back umpteen times to check on the consequences of those decisions. What was hooking in his players the most, he saw, was the ability to communicate with one another while they played.</p>

<p>The popularity of iMob and a few other apps—and the blast of revenue the company enjoyed once the app store did open in 2008—got Leydon noticed. The company, renamed Machine Zone in 2012, raised a reported $13 million from Menlo Ventures, Anthos Capital, Baseline Ventures, and other sources, to start developing what became Game of War: Fire Age. “What we’re doing,” he said in 2012, “is creating a more social experience and then wrapping a game around it.”  It took a team of 80 people 19 months to build the app; still stinging from what happened with iMob, Leydon wouldn’t launch it until it underwent nine months of testing and five months of live beta. To allow for the building alliances, Leydon knew the game needed a sophisticated chat feature. So in the middle of development, Leydon decided that it made sense for everyone in the game to speak the same language. So he called for the creation of a mobile messaging platform within the game, including a translation engine based on not only on Google Translate but on crowd-sourcing. “Like a lot of technology CEOs who aren’t engineers, I feel a little guilt,” he says. “It’s like, ‘I’m so lame, I’m not an engineer.’ But there’s maybe a little bonus in it, because when they tell you something can’t be done, I say, ‘Well, why can’t you do it?’” </p>

<p>Within Game of War, for the first time anywhere, text messages, comments, and push notifications all are translated with something like 70 percent accuracy. Log in to the game in Polish, and everything you read from other players is in Polish, too. The game’s own players correct any errors they notice in exchange for virtual rewards within the game. From the start, the average player corrected ten misspellings and slang expressions per day. Leydon says dozens of companies have asked to license the translation engine for their software.  The applications obviously span beyond gaming and into finance, logistics, social networking, and data analysis. “When people were relying on it to talk to their friends, friends that they couldn’t have any other way, that’s when I realized how very necessary this really is,” he said shortly after the game launched . </p>


<p>But Leydon says the ability to translate slang in chat is nothing compared to the game’s other innovation. Game of War can accommodate some 3 million players in simultaneous play, with what the company clocked as a .2 second response time. The closest thing even remotely like it would be Eve Online, the PC-based virtual-reality environment that, like Second Life and multiplayer console games like World of Warcraft, has its millions of users cordoned off into separate servers called shards, which are able to keep tabs on what every player is doing at once. But while not more than 65,000 people play together on a shard of Eve at any time, Machine Zone abandoned the shard model altogether. “Game of War is built around a cloud kind of system,” Leydon says, “where the game doesn’t need to know where everyone is. It can process messages very fast allowing synchronization to happen at very low latency speed.” </p>

<p>That means no lag time, no language barrier, and virtually no limit on the number of people playing together. “It’s closer to a social network than it is a video game,” Leydon says. “Facebook has pokes and messages and things like that. In Game of War, you have attacks and friends and chats.” But Leydon argues that those comparisons aren’t at the same scale. “People in Russia can play against people here in a complex experience—not just sending a chat message.” People are investing in economies together, building cities together, going to war together, conquering the world together. </p>

<p>“People look at ads and top grosses, and they don’t look at what Game of War really is,” Leydon says, his voice rising. “This is the largest real-time concurrent interactive application ever built. There’s nothing even close to it.”</p>



<p>Even some of the people who don’t like Game of War—more than one reviewer finds its user interface cluttered, its rules incomprehensible—appreciate how richly textured it is for the small percentage of users willing to immerse themselves in the experience. “The interesting thing about Machine Zone is in the mobile game space, they’re a very niche product compared to a Candy Crush Saga or even Clash of Clans,” says Patrick Walker of EEDAR, a market-research company. “Their TV campaign was as broad as can be, with a supermodel and these fun battles. But the game itself is these deep relationships with clans and resource management. It’s not like playing a shoot-’em-up game or a sports game. The people interested in the game are willing to invest more time to understand these deep complex rules.”</p>

		“We’re a technology company,” Leydon says. “We’re not really a game company.”
	</div>
</div>
<p>This seems counterintuitive at first. Why advertise a niche game to more than 100 million people  during the Super Bowl? But Leydon isn’t exactly looking for scale. Calling Game of war a “niche scale product,” he’s casting a wide net to catch the whales of the free-to-play business model. Few of those tens of thousands of daily downloads will stick around, and he’s fine with that. </p>


<p>“I don’t need to have everybody on the earth like it,” Leydon says. “I just need to make it for the people that do like it.” That’s pretty much the solemn creed of the free-to-play world. “App games are like coin-operated games,” he says, motioning over to the old America’s Army machine. “Just like the arcade game, most people pass it by. Only a very small amount of people stop and put their quarter in. And the people who put a quarter in, if you can’t fulfill or exceed their expectations, you won’t get a ‘continue.’ They have to want to stay.” </p>

<p>It may be a wise bet. The gaming audience that’s growing the most, up 6 percent last year to a 22-percent portion of the overall audience, is what the NPD Group’s study calls “avid omni gamers,” or the people most likely to spend money on micro-transactions, or “in-app purchases,” inside a game they’ve downloaded for free but have grown to love, or at least obsess over. From the start, Machine Zone was recording long user times in Game of War that defied expectations. “The average player plays for two hours per day,” Leydon noted in a 2013 talk. “They play 12-minute sessions, ten a day.” </p>

<p>More empire-building games are entering the free-to-play market; Zynga, creator of FarmVille, has been working on a game called Dawn of Titans for more than a year. Leydon, meanwhile, intends to focus on what his new networking technology can accomplish outside the gaming world. “If you use a game company right, it’s like NASA,” he says. “You send someone to the moon, you get Styrofoam. With a videogame, you can solve impractical problems, like a million people in a chat room.” He is deliberately vague about his plans. Finance, healthcare, and maps are just three areas he mentions. “We’re a technology company, we’re not really a game company,” he says. “What we accomplished here is actually where we’re going next. Getting so many devices to participate in the same experience at the same time—that’s going to be the most important part of the business.”
